# CHAPTER 1: DEFINING DATA GOVERNANCE
Data governance is all about managing data well, but data governance is not restricted to only data management.
-Governance is a manner in which an entity chooses to oversee the control and direction of an area of interest.

Data Governance vs Data Management
-Data Governance is focused on roles and responsibilities, policies, definitions, metrics and lifestyle of data.
- Data management is the technical implementation of data governance

The Value of Data Governance
Some of the main advantages achieved by good data governance include:

-Improved Data Quality
-Expanded data value
-Increased data compliance
-Enhanced business performance

CREATING A DATA GOVERNANCE PROGRAM
The basic steps for creating a data governance program consist of the following:
-Defining the vision, goals, and benefits.
-Analyzing the current state of data governance and management.
-Developing a proposal based on the first two steps, including a draft plan.
-Achieving leadership approval.
-Designing and developing the program.
-Implementing the program.
-Monitoring and measuring performance.
-Maintaining the program.

DEVELOPING A DATA GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK
The most important qualities of a data governance framework:

Leadership and Strategy - Your data governance program must be aligned with the strategy of the organization.

Roles and Responsibilities - Your data governance program will only be possible with the right people doing the right things at the right time. 

Policies, Processes and Standards - At the heart of every data governance program are the policies, processes, and standards that guide responsibilities and support uniformity across the organization

Metrics - Capturing metrics and delivering them to a variety of stakeholders is important for maintaining support, which includes funding.

Tools - Fortunately, a large marketplace now exists for tools in support of data governance and management. These include tools for master data management, data catalogs, search, security, integration, analytics, and compliance. 

Communication and Collaboration - With the introduction of data governance and the ongoing, sometimes evolving, requirements, high-quality communications are key.

PREPARING FOR DATA GOVERNANCE
What is data culture?
Refers to the set of values, practices, and behaviors within an organization that encourages the widespread and effective use of data to drive decision-making and improve performance.

Assessing the Data Culture
