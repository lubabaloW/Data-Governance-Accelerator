# CHAPTER 1: DEFINING DATA GOVERNANCE
Data governance is all about managing data well, but data governance is not restricted to only data management.
-Governance is a manner in which an entity chooses to oversee the control and direction of an area of interest.

Data Governance vs Data Management
-Data Governance is focused on roles and responsibilities, policies, definitions, metrics and lifestyle of data.
- Data management is the technical implementation of data governance

The Value of Data Governance
Some of the main advantages achieved by good data governance include:

-Improved Data Quality
-Expanded data value
-Increased data compliance
-Enhanced business performance

CREATING A DATA GOVERNANCE PROGRAM
The basic steps for creating a data governance program consist of the following:
-Defining the vision, goals, and benefits.
-Analyzing the current state of data governance and management.
-Developing a proposal based on the first two steps, including a draft plan.
-Achieving leadership approval.
-Designing and developing the program.
-Implementing the program.
-Monitoring and measuring performance.
-Maintaining the program.

DEVELOPING A DATA GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK
The most important qualities of a data governance framework:

Leadership and Strategy - Your data governance program must be aligned with the strategy of the organization.

Roles and Responsibilities - Your data governance program will only be possible with the right people doing the right things at the right time. 

Policies, Processes and Standards - At the heart of every data governance program are the policies, processes, and standards that guide responsibilities and support uniformity across the organization

Metrics - Capturing metrics and delivering them to a variety of stakeholders is important for maintaining support, which includes funding.

Tools - Fortunately, a large marketplace now exists for tools in support of data governance and management. These include tools for master data management, data catalogs, search, security, integration, analytics, and compliance. 

Communication and Collaboration - With the introduction of data governance and the ongoing, sometimes evolving, requirements, high-quality communications are key.

PREPARING FOR DATA GOVERNANCE
What is data culture?
Refers to the set of values, practices, and behaviors within an organization that encourages the widespread and effective use of data to drive decision-making and improve performance.

Assessing the Data Culture
Effective data cultures support and empower all employees, from the newest intern to the CEO, to access and use meaningful and timely data for their work. Such cultures ensure that employees have attained the skills they need to use data analytics and can make good data-driven decisions. 

MATURING THE DATA CULTURE
-Help leaders communicate the value of data and model the type of behavior that demonstrates that data is a priority.
-Provide basic tools and education for data use that include manipulating data, analytics, data cleansing, basic query commands, and visualization.
-Do something, even if it’s small, to show progress. 
-Recognize that resistance and frustration are part of the journey.

# CHAPTER 2 
DEFINING DATA
Data is also defined based on its captured format. Specifically, at a high level, it falls into one of the following categories:

--Structured: Data that has been formatted to a set structure; each data unit fits nicely into a table in a database. It’s ready for analysis. Examples include first name, last name, and phone number.
--Unstructured: Data that are stored in a native format must be processed to be used. Further work is required to enable analysis. Examples include email content and social media posts.
--Semi-structured: Data that contains additional information to enable the native format to be searched and analyzed.


The differences between Data and Information

Data - Raw
     - Items such as characters, words, pictures, and numbers that have no meaning in 
       isolation
     - No analysis dependency
Information - Processed 
            - Data that is organized and given context to have meaning
            - Dependent on the analysis of data


Data Ownership
Describes the rights a person, team, or organization has over one or more data sets.


Data Architecture
Is the manner in which data design and management decisions are being made to align with EA and in turn, with the business.

Enterprise Architecture
Is a practice of designing the technical needs of an organization to support its business strategy. 

At a minimum, data architecture considers and typically supports the following:

--Ensuring data is available to those who need it and are approved to use it.
--Reducing the complexity of accessing and utilizing data
--Creating and enforcing data protections to support organizational policies and obligations.
--Adopting and agreeing to data standards
--Optimizing the flow and efficient use of data to eliminate bottlenecks and duplication.

THE LIFE CYCLE OF DATA
--Creation:  This is the stage at which data comes into being.
--Storage:  Once data is created and assuming you want it available for later use, it must be stored
--Usage: Data may need to be processed to be useful.
--Archival:  In this stage, you identify data that is not currently being used and move it to a long-term storage system out of your production environment.
--Destruction:  Data destruction involves making data inaccessible and unreadable.

DEFINING BIG DATA
One way to define and characterize big data is through these five Vs:

--Volume: The sheer scale of data being produced is unprecedented and requires new tools, skills, and processes.
--Variety: There are already a lot of legacy file formats, such as CSV and MP3, and with new innovations, new formats are emerging all the time. This requires different methods of handling, from analysis to security.
--Velocity: With so many collection points, digital interfaces, and ubiquitous connectivity, data is being created and moved at increasing speed. Consider that in 2021, Instagram users created, uploaded, and share 65,000 pictures a minute.
--Variability:  The fact that the creation and flow of data are unpredictable.
--Veracity:  The quality, including accuracy and truthfulness, of large volume of disparate sets of data, can differ considerably, causing challenges to data management.

SMART DATA
Defines big data that's been optimally prepared for use to deliver the highest business value.


# CHAPTER 3: DRIVING VALUE THROUGH DATA
IDENTIFYING THE ROLES OF DATA

Operations
Concern themselves with a diverse set of activities to run the day-to-day needs and drive the mission of an organization.

Strategy
Creating a strategy typically comes down to a core set of activities. It begins with an analysis of the environment followed by some conclusions on what has been gathered. Finally, a plan is developed, driven by some form of guiding principles. These principles may be derived from the nature of the work, the values of the founders, or some other factors.

Decision - Making
The outcome of decisions based on bad data could range from a minor mistake to job termination right up to the closing of the business.

Measuring
Data measurements can be quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative data is most often described in numerical terms, whereas qualitative data is descriptive and expressed in terms of language.

Monitoring
Monitoring is another process that converts data into insight and as such, exists as a mechanism to guide decisions. The role of data in measurement and monitoring often go hand-in-hand.

Insight Management
Insight management begins with gathering and analyzing data from different sources. In order to determine what data to process, those responsible for insight management must deeply understand the organization’s information needs. 

Reporting
Reports are typically online or physical presentations of data and information on some aspect of an organization.
--For example, a written and printed report may show all the sales of a particular product or service during a specific period. 
--Sometimes a report is given verbally in person or via a live or recorded video.

Other Roles for Data
Artificial Intelligence(AI)
Problem - Solving
Data Reuse

APPROACHING DATA AS AN ASSET

--An asset is something that is owned by a person, an organization, or a government with the expectation that it can bring some economic benefit.
--An asset can be tangible or intangible. 
   Tangible assets are physical things such as inventory, machines, and property.
   An intangible asset is the opposite; it’s a non-physical thing like software, 
   copyrights, a brand, and goodwill. 
-- Data is an intangible asset.

After it is processed from its raw form, data has the potential to create enormous economic value for all manner of stakeholders. Here are some examples of the economic value of data:

-Improves operations.
-Increases existing revenue.
-Produces new forms of revenue.
-Builds relationships with customers and other stakeholders.
-Improves the quality of products and services.
-Contributes to competitive advantage.
-Enables innovation.
-Reduces risk.

DATA ANALYTICS
The process of examining data in order to produce answers or find conclusions is called data analytics.

Basics steps in data analysis:

1. Data Mining - Identifying and extracting relevant data from data sources.
2. Data Cleaning - Sizable effort including removing errors and duplicate data in preparation for analysis.
3. Statistical Analysis - Using statistical methods and artificial intelligence to interpret results and develop insights.
4. Data Presentation - Communicating results using a variety of techniques including visualization and data-storytelling.

Data analytics has four primary types:
-- Descriptive:  Existing data sets of historical data are accessed, and analysis is performed to determine what the data tells stakeholders about the performance of a key performance indicator (KPI) or other business objectives. It is insight on past performance.
-- Diagnostic:  As the term suggests, this analysis tries to glean from the data the answer to why something happened. It takes descriptive analysis and looks at the cause.
-- Predictive:  In this approach, the analyst uses techniques to determine what may occur in the future. It applies tools and techniques to historical data and trends to predict the likelihood of certain outcomes.
-- Prescriptive:  This analysis focuses on what action should be taken. In combination with predictive analytics, prescriptive techniques provide estimates of the probabilities of a variety of future outcomes.

Data Management
Data management processes involve the collection, storage, organization, maintenance, and analytics of an organization’s data. It includes the architecture of technology systems such that data can flow across the enterprise and be accessed whenever and by whom it is approved for use. 

Governing Data

The success of governing data can be reduced to three essential factors:
-- People:  While recognizing that data is increasingly created and used exclusively by machines without human intervention, handling and benefiting from data is still a highly people-centric exercise
-- Policies:  A data policy contains a set of adopted rules by an organization that apply to the handling of data in specific conditions and for particular desired outcomes. 
-- Metrics:  It’s largely true, what gets measured gets managed. In developing policies in support of data governance, you have to consider how each is measured.
